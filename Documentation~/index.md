# About Vulpes Transitions

The Vulpes Transitions package is a Promise driven transition system that provides a number of components that can be used as a substitute for common animations such as moving a Transform between two points or fading a CanvasGroup in or out.

## Understanding Promises

This Framework relies heavily on [Vulpes Promises](https://github.com/VulpesSoftware/com.vulpes.promises) which is a package that was derived from RSGâ€™s [C# Promises](https://github.com/Real-Serious-Games/C-Sharp-Promise) library.

In order to use this library effectively you should first learn about Promises:
- [Promises on Wikpedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises)
- [Good overview](https://www.promisejs.org/)
- [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
